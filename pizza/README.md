The code challenge is a “Pizza Ordering App”

Your task is to build an app for ordering Pizza with mocked APIs from the Apiary specification using React.

• Show a list of pizza restaurants and have the closest to your current location at the top

• From the list enter into a detailed view for that restaurant and display the available menu for that location.

• Let the users add items from the menu into a shopping cart

• Place the order

• Display the orders state You can find the API’s here: https://pizzaapp.docs.apiary.io/

Please note that the apis are mocked so you will always get the same response
